# settings.py

# Screen dimensions
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Game settings
# Define additional game settings here such as:
# FPS = 60
# TILE_SIZE = 32
# MAX_RESOURCES = 1000
# STARTING_POPULATION = 50
# etc.

# You can also define color constants, game levels, or any other configurable parameters here. 
# This approach makes it easy to adjust these values without having to dig into the main game logic.

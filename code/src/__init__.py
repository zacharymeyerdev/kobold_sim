# __init__.py

# This is an initialization file for the src package.
# It can be left empty or used to define package-level details
# such as version number, author information, or to import key classes/functions
# from other modules within the src package for easier access.

# Example:
# from .game import Game
# from .colony import Colony
# from .building import Building
# from .resource import Resource
# etc. 

# By importing classes/functions here, you can simplify imports in other parts of your project.
# For example, instead of 'from src.game import Game', you can just use 'from src import Game'.
